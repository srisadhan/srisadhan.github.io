This projects concentrates on classifying the type of task being performed by the human in collaboration with a admittance controlled robot. Any physical task can be categorized as Fine, Gross or Fine-Gross based on the required human motor skills. By detecting the type of task being performed, the parameters (admittance control gains) of the robot can be tuned to improve the quality of interaction. Here, the Electromyography (EMG) signals recorded from the Myo armband attached to the human arm are used for the classification of task in real-time.
