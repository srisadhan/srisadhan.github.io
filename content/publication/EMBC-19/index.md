abstract: In a robotic rehabilitation setup, patient's safety and interaction stability are critical throughout the therapy. This paper addresses the stability aspect by proposing a method to vary the endpoint stiffness using a variable impedance mechanism. The proposed device consists of permanent magnets in an antagonistic configuration that acts as springs and the variation in stiffness is achieved by modifying the separation between those magnets. This device is mounted on the end-effector of an admittance controlled robotic arm and tested with the help of healthy humans on a virtual maze traversal experiment consisting of both fine and gross motor regions. Moreover, the subjects are tested both in normal and simulated tremor conditions to verify the effectiveness of the device. The experimental results show that the VSM can not only suppress the high-frequency forces but can also reduce the interference of human endpoint stiffness in the stability of the robot.
