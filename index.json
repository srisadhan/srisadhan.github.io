A low effort collaborative task is simulated with the help of an admittance controlled robot. The performance of this robot for different levels of grasp stiffness are compared and a solution in the form of a Variable Stiffness Mechanism is provided. This mechanism provides an opportunity to modify the stiffness at the port of interaction based on two measures, an instability index in the frequency domain, and human muscle contraction in the time domain. Experimental results show an improvement in the performance and stability for the system with high stiffness vs low stiffness. Human muscle contraction provides a time instant at which the stiffness has to be modified and the instability index value provides information about the direction in which the stiffness has to be modified.","tags":null,"title":"Stiffness Based Stability Enhancement in Human-Robot Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sri Sadhan Jujjavarapu","Ehsan T.

This paper addresses the stability aspect by proposing a method to vary the endpoint stiffness using a variable impedance mechanism. The proposed device consists of permanent magnets in an antagonistic configuration that acts as springs and the variation in stiffness is achieved by modifying the separation between those magnets. This device is mounted on the end-effector of an admittance controlled robotic arm and tested with the help of healthy humans on a virtual maze traversal experiment consisting of both fine and gross motor regions. Moreover, the subjects are tested both in normal and simulated tremor conditions to verify the effectiveness of the device. The experimental results show that the VSM can not only suppress the high-frequency forces but can also reduce the interference of human endpoint stiffness in the stability of the robot.","tags":null,"title":"Improving Stability in Upper Limb Rehabilitation Using Variable Stiffness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sri Sadhan Jujjavarapu","Hemanth Manjunatha","Dr. Ehsan T Esfahani"],"categories":null,"content":"Variable stiffness actuators can be used in a variety of robotics applications for dynamic manipulation tasks such as hammering a nail or flipping a burger. Here, a semi-active variable stiffness mechanism is used for enhancing the dynamic manipulation of a stiff robot. The mechanism is attached to the end-effector of a robot and its performance is investigated over a hammering task. The hammering task is posed as an optimal control problem to maximize the velocity of the hammer-head while hitting the nail. The problem is solved to obtain an optimal end-effector trajectory of the robot and the desired mechanism stiffness as a function of time. The performance of the mechanism is then tested for three different stiffness settings on the obtained trajectory. Through experiments, we show that the mechanism can achieve higher velocities in the variable stiffness setting when compared to the stiff actuation.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"5bee52027c86741d3f3b08aded3e2c27","permalink":"/project/hammering/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hammering/","section":"project","summary":"Optimal control strategy for a compliant mechanism to perform dynamic tasks such as hammering a nail or flipping a burger.","tags":["Optimal Control, Variable Stiffness actuator"],"title":"Optimal Control of a Variable Stiffness Mechanism for the Hammering Task","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sri Sadhan Jujjavarapu","Amir Memar","Dr. Ehsan T Esfahani"],"categories":null,"content":"Note: All the above images on this page are shot by Douglas Levere and are the property of Human in the Loop Systems lab, University at Buffalo.

Compliance on the grasp handle is achieved by suspending it in between magnets in preloaded repelling configuration to act as nonlinear springs. By adjusting the air gaps between the outer magnets, the stiffness of the mechanism in each direction can be adjusted independently. Moreover, the capability of the proposed design in suppressing unintended interaction forces is evaluated in two different experiments. In the first experiment, improper admittance controller gain leads to unstable interaction, whereas in the second case, high-frequency involuntary forces are caused by the tremor.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Variable Stiffness Mechanism for Suppressing Unintended Forces in Physical Human–Robot Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sri Sadhan Jujjavarapu","M.

This paper presents the analysis of a single degree of freedom variable stiffness actuator based on nonlinear force interactions between permanent magnets and its effect on the natural frequency of the system. In the proposed mechanism, variable stiffness is achieved by modifying the separation between magnets. The main goal here is to achieve a desired cutoff frequency by varying the stiffness of the system to filter out the involuntary movement of upper limb during physical human-robot interactions. Moreover, due to the spring-like non-contact force interactions between magnets, this mechanism can prevent the exchange of high impact forces between the robot and human.","tags":null,"title":"Variable Stiffness Mechanism for Tremor Suppression in Human-Robot Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sri Sadhan Jujjavarapu","Amirhossein H.
